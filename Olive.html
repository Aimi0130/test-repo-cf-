          <h2>Purpose&Context</h2>
          <p>Olive was a solo project which is part of UX course at Career Foundry.
          </p>

          <div>
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>The goal of the project was to build a responsive app that enables users to make healthy habits in the long run to improve/ keep their healthy lives. The problem I wanted to solve, was to develop an app that elevates users' motivation
              to keep their habits while eliminating their friction points during the activities.</p>

          <div>
            <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
            <p>Contents provided by our competitors are telling what is required for our future users. To make our path more clear and “to-the-point”, I started by analyzing our competitors.
            </p>

            <h2>Assumption</h2>
            <p>Researching what users had to say about competing apps, I made the following assumptions.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h2>Surveys&Interviews</h2>
            <p>I conducted online surveys and interviews together with competitor analysis to identify what users feel about existing apps. I got response from  53 participants and through the research, I could find out users’ pain points and
              expectations.

              <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
              <p>Initially, I thought users’ main challenge was that they would get bored and that keeping track would be a chore.
                However, hearing users’ voices, I found that not only their activities became monotonous, but also that the lack of encouragement from other people was a challenge. We also found that they believe that third-party support is effective
                in achieving their goals.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h2>Key Features</h2>
              <p>Based on the analysis, I defined important features as below</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Ability to set goals and track progress</li>
                <li>Ability to add notes </li>
                <li>Ability to get access to knowledge supported by specialists</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>User Personas</h2>
              <p>Then, based on the interviews and surveys, I established Sayaka and Adam as 2 main personas.
                Sayaka has strong interests in maintaining her health from a young age for her work and Adam feels anxieties about his current health and wants to improve to balance work and family. 
                One thing they both have in common is that they do not have much time to exercise/rest on a regular basis hence prefer to take some exercises whenever they find extra time.

                      <li>For the sake of usability, moved the expert category to the top of the list, which is the mainstream in our competitors' designs.

                      <li>As the one of the students pointed out ,avoided gradient backgrounds which can cause visual distraction and changed to a simple background color.
                      </li>
                      <li>As revealed in the survey, the most significant issue was the time and effort required to keep records, so I set up an option to record mood intuitively.

                      <p>Initially, the intention was to provide content that would entertain users who might otherwise become bored with their healthy habits. However, through the user interviews, I realized that it was not only the content that was
                        important, but also the involvement of a third party and the ability to keep record of their health conditions.
                        As a result, I decided to fulfill this need by simultaneously providing the opportunity to get direct advice from specialists and simplifying the record-keeping steps.
                        The next step will be to think about how I can motivate users by creating an effective reminder and reward system, and to aim for a seamless experience where each content is interrelated.</p>
